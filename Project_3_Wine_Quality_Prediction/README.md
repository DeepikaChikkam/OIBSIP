# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction - Advanced Classification (Project 3)

### **Objective**
To build a robust classification model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes, demonstrating skills in Regression/Classification model comparison.

### **Methodology and Key Results**
* **Data Preprocessing:** Standardized chemical features using **StandardScaler** to optimize model performance.
* **Model Comparison:** Compared Logistic Regression, SVC, and **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**.
* **Best Model:** **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**.
* **Performance:** Achieved **89.5% Accuracy** and a strong **F1 Score of 0.5814** for the target (Good Quality Wine), confirming RFC's effectiveness for multi-class structured data.

### **Deliverable**
The final, optimized model, saved as `RFC_Wine_Quality_Classifier.pkl`, is ready for deployment as a high-speed prediction service.
