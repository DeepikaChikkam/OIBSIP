# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection (Project 1)

### **Objective**
To build a robust machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions in a severely imbalanced financial dataset.

### **Key Results**
* **Best Model:** **XGBoost Classifier**
* **Performance Metric:** Achieved a crucial **AUC-PR score of 0.8326**, demonstrating superior detection ability on rare fraud cases.
* **Deployment Ready:** The final model was saved as a `.pkl` file, ready for a low-latency microservice to handle **Real-time Monitoring** and **Scalability**.
